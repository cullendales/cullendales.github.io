			<p>
				I'm a software developer from Vancouver, Canada who is passionate about always learning.<br>
        		My first degree was in Kinesiology where I gained skills in research, thinking about systems<br>
        		as a whole, and an understanding of how customers interact with products. These skills have<br>
        		enabled me to be a better software developer. I am constantly writing new programs and thinking<br>
        		of new ways to improve upon my old ones. When I'm not coding, I'm enjoying the beaches around<br>
        		Vancouver or in the mountains.
