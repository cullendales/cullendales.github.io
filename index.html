		<h2> Website being developed.</h2>
		<h1>About Me</h1> 
		<p> I'm a software developer from Vancouver, Canada who is passionate about always learning. <br> 
			My first degree was in Kinesiology where I gained skills in research, thinking about <br>
			systems as a whole, and an understanding of how customers interact with products. These <br>
			skills have enabled me to be a better software developer. I am constantly writing new <br>
			programs and thinking of new ways to improve upon my old ones. When I'm not coding, I'm <br>
			enjoying the beaches around Vancouver or in the mountains. </p>

		<p> Please enjoy some Pong while waiting for my website to be finished or enjoy my coding <br>
			portfolio below </p>
